"It was biting cold, and the falling snow,<br>Which filled a poor little match girl\'s heart with woe,<br>Who was bareheaded and barefooted, as she went along the street,<br>Crying, \"Who\'ll buy my matches? for I want pennies to buy some meat!\"<br>When she left home she had slippers on;<br>But, alas! poor child, now they were gone.<br>For she lost both of them while hurrying across the street,<br>Out of the way of two carriages which were near by her feet.<br><br>So the little girl went on, while the snow fell thick and fast;<br>And the child's heart felt cold and downcast,<br>For nobody had bought any matchea that day,<br>Which filled her little mind with grief and dismay.<br>Alas! she was hungry and shivering with cold;<br>So in a corner between two houses she made bold<br>To take shelter from the violent storm.<br>Poor little waif! wishing to herself she'd never been born.<br><br>And she grew colder and colder, and feared to go home<br>For fear of her father beating her; and she felt woe-begone<br>Because she could carry home no pennies to buy bread,<br>And to go home without pennies she was in dread.<br>The large flakes of snow covered her ringlets of fair hair;<br>While the passers-by for her had no care,<br>As they hurried along to their homes at a quick pace,<br>While the cold wind blew in the match girl's face.<br><br>As night wore on her hands were numb with cold,<br>And no longer her strength could her uphold,<br>When an idea into her little head came:<br>She'd strike a match and warm her hands at the flame.<br>And she lighted the match, and it burned brightly,<br>And it helped to fill her heart with glee;<br>And she thought she was sitting at a stove very grand;<br>But, alas! she was found dead, with a match in her hand!",
"YE sons of Germany, your noble Emperor William now is dead.<br>Who oft great armies to battle hath led;<br>He was a man beloved by his subjects all,<br>Because he never tried them to enthral.<br><br>He was much respected throughout Europe by the high and the low,<br>And all over Germany people's hearts are full of woe;<br>For in the battlefield he was a hero bold,<br>Nevertheless, a lover of peace, to his credit be it told.<br><br>'Twas in the year of 1888, and on March the 16th day,<br>That the peaceful William's remains were conveyed away.<br>The funeral service was conducted in the cathedral by the court chaplain, Dr. Kogel,<br>Which touched the hearts of his hearers, as from his lips it fell,<br>And in conclusion he recited the Lord's Prayer<br>In the presence of kings, princes, dukes, and counts assembled there.<br>And at the end of the service the infantry outside fired volley after volley,<br>While the people inside the cathedral felt melancholy.",
"Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silv\'ry Tay!<br>Alas!
