Instructions
The hack connects to the internet so it WILL get blocked by antiviruses and firewalls. Please disable any antivirus or firewall you have while you are using the hack, i already had complaints regarding this and the problems were fixed once they turned off the firewall. You can rest assured that the hack is harmless and will not affect your computer in any way, turning off your av/firewall is required just so the hack can authenticate and identify you as a VIP. If it gets blocked it won’t be able to do that and it will close your game.
