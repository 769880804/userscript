The great thing about Playstation network is that you no longer have to have a PC to intereact with your friends , now you can play your favorite PS3 and PSP games with friends or the PSN community  online . Before we continue with explaining what PSN code generator is lets see what these codes are.
PSN Codes are a virtual currency that can be used instead of credit card to purchase Playstation Games , expansions and downloadable content . Much like the Xbox , these codes can be bought with real money  which is not a very good way since its not free and not all members have credit cards . We are here to discuss a two ways of getting a free cards for PlayStation Network.First is Our  Free PSN Codes Giveaway which is explained later in this post. The Other , for some members more popular way for getting free codes is the PlayStation Network Code Generator or simply PSN Code Generator which is used in daily giveaways.
What is PSN Code Generator and Daily Giveaways?
Much like our Microsoft Points Generator for XBOX 360 , the this generator for PS3 codes is one of the two ways to get gift cards like The Free PSN Card Codes here at Giftcardsbay.com . One part of the codes is dedicated to our Premium Giveaways which are given to our most active facebook ,twitter and youtube members for sharing and inviting other members to join the giveaway. More about it later in the post.
But since here at Gift Cards Bay we want all of our members to be able to get the codes they need, even those who donâ€™t have facebook or twitter we came up with the Generator as the software for daily giveaways.Its a simple tool that searches our servers for the the new gift cards which we dedicate to this purpose each day until all the codes are given. There is no hacking of PlayStation involved and all keys are donated by our sponsors. Here you can see how it looks like and download it.
