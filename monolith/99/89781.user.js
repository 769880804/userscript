Captcha Helper is a greasemonkey script that automatically processes the captchas, it increases exponentially the chances of redeeming something redemptions.

Basically you could say it's a kind of self captcha, so you no longer have to waste time writing the captcha.

Is detectable?

To all, I've been using for a long time, all my iPods were purchased using this script along with the other standard scripts that populate the data. All my awards redeemed were approved.
