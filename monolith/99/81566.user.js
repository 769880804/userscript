// This script can help you to remove the Hotspot Shield Adbar
// hanging over every page that you visit when HSS is on. This
// script intend to give everyone a better user experience and 
// make the Hotspot Shield better.
// 
// I'm not a pro, and my code is nasty, but it's useful in some
// way. Hope you'll like it!
// 
// Note: When you use this script in low speed connection, the
// HSS ad bar will still show, while page is loading, however 
// it will do disappear as the page finish up load. Not very
// perfect, but it still works for me (maybe you, too). ;P
