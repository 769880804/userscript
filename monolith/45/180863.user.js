Battlefield 4 Full Download for PC Free Full Version Full Cracked [Easy] Latest For PS3/Xbox/IPAD/IOS/Android


If you’ve already pre-ordered Battlefield 4 and you’re now waiting for the download to complete, you can safely disregard this article. (At my current speed of 2 MB/sec, I’ll happily be able to finish downloading today on Sunday). Remember: the best deal on the pre-order is currently $48 from GMG (use coupon TAREM-BF4NA-BOOM1). For the UK/EU, you get an instant discount of 20%/12% on BF4 Premium. The price on the BF4 base game is £35.99 in the UK after discount, while the EU price is 42.52€.

Unless you’re downloading from a high-speed location (such as a college campus, or wherever our friend pictured here with a 13.03 MB/sec download speed is), you should get started now if you want to be ready to play at release (Tuesday, October 29 at 12:01AM EDT).

Pre-load Started Saturday for North America

Those in North America got a pleasant surprise on Saturday when pre-load started at 9:00AM Pacific Time. Whether you have the Regular Edition of Battlefield 4 or the Digital Deluxe Edition, you’ll be able to start downloading the full game client.

Pre-Load for UK and Europe Starts Monday

If you’re holding a pre-order copy that’s region-restricted to the UK or Europe, you’ll be stuck waiting to pre-load until Monday, October 28 at 11:00 CET. EA has posted an official worldwide pre-load and release schedule on their support site. Don’t forget: those in the EU, AU, and NZ get a later release date of October 31st, 2013.
