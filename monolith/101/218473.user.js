 Super Bowl XLVIII Tickets

 The Game

 The Super Bowl is the biggest game of the season in the National Football League, and could be the biggest game of any sport in the United States of America. Super Bowl Sunday has become a holiday in itself in the U.S., and fans from all around the country flock to whatever city is hosting the game to be a part of the awe-inspiring spectacle that the Super Bowl has evolved into over the years. This game features the two best teams in the National Football League as they battle it out for the right to be named NFL Champions, a distinction that allows a team to live on forever in the lore of sports.

 The 2014 game, Super Bowl XLVIII, is a special one, as the game is going to be played at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ. What makes that special is the fact that the Super Bowl has been played in warm weather cities, or cities with a dome stadium, for a long time now, and the league decided to buck that trend. MetLife Stadium is just a short drive from New York City, the biggest market in the country, so this is set to be one of the biggest Super Bowls of all time.

 Fans from across the nation will be looking to gain access to MetLife Stadium for this game. The NFC Champion will face off with the AFC Champion in a game that is watched by millions of people around the world. The Super Bowl always features some of the best players in the National Football League, and fans in attendance are often wowed by the incredible ability of these athletes. Be a part of Super Bowl XLVIII by being there in the stands, as it's an experience that you're sure to remember for a long time.

 The League

 The National Football League is the premier sports league in the United States of America for a reason, as it boasts some of the most incredible athletes known to man. The NFL has become renowned for its brand of exciting football that you can't find anywhere else in the world. With quarterbacks that can put the ball anywhere on the field, running backs that can make a move to avoid a defender and be on a breakaway for the end zone in no time, receivers that routinely make highlight reel catches and defensive players that put some of the hardest hits on opponents game in and game out, the NFL is simply the cream of the crop when it comes to a sports-watching experience.

 People from all over the world love the National Football League, and there is even talk of the NFL going global. There are already multiple games played in London, England each and every season, and many people thinks it's only a matter of time before the league has teams based in Europe. The NFL is taking over for a reason, because it's simply riveting to see a game in person when these amazing athletes hit the field to do battle on the gridiron.

 The Experience

 There is nothing better than seeing a sporting event live and in person. Sports have been a part of cultures around the world for a very long time, and spectators have always enjoyed watching athletes compete at the highest of levels. When you're there in the stands at a sporting event like this one, you're treated to seeing some of the most talented athletes in the entire world going head to head with everything on the line. There's nothing that compares to the atmosphere at a game, where you're surrounded by fans that are all there to enjoy a great spectacle of sport.

 Being there in the stands for the Super Bowl is one of the most special experiences you can have as a football fan. The Super Bowl is the biggest game in American sports, and only a few lucky fans have the chance to see the action unfold live each and every year. The atmosphere at a game of this caliber is sure to be something that you've never been a part of before.

 History

 The first Super Bowl, known as Super Bowl I, was played in 1967 between the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs. At the time, the National Football League and American Football League were separate leagues that has been in competition with one another for years. The invention of the Super Bowl is what would really set the wheels in motion towards the now-famous 1970 merging of the two leagues into the more modern structure of the National Football League. The original NFL teams were grouped into the National Football Conference, while the AFL team were grouped into the American Football Conference, each a part of the NFL. The Packers won Super Bowl I, and would win Super Bowl II as well. The most famous Super Bowl in the history of the game was played in 1969, when the underdog New York Jets took down the heavily-favored Baltimore Colts. Jets quarterback Joe Namath famously guaranteed a victory before the New York win.

 Trivia

 Where was Super Bowl I played?

 The answer is Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, CA.
