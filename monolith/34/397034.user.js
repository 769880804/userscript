Hi there! Nice that you are interested in my method. Make sure to read the whole guide, It’s not that long anyways! And remember, the most important thing is to TAKE ACTION NOW!
Enjoy!




The Method

It’s pretty simple: We share PC-Game demo codes and demos!




What you need:

A webhosting to host WordPress. I highly reccomend hostgator.com as it lets you install WordPress from it’s admin panel easily! 
A domain name related to video game betas 
A neat WordPress design! Get a nice free template somewhere. 

Youtube Accounts! If you can’t make them yourself, get some from http://www.mycheapjobs.com/Social-Marketing/5736/give-you-10-youtube-PVA-accounts 

Youtube likes for your videos! This is almost essential for your videos to get noticed! You can order from the same guy i always order from, as i know he provides them fast and good! - > http://www.mycheapjobs.com/Social-Marketing/5737/give-you-50-Real-Human-likes-for-your-Youtube-video-QUICKLY 

I know it’s not a free method, you have to invest a little bit, but it will pay off really soon!
Now, lets get to work. Set up your wordpress blog on your new domain with a neat design.

Step 1: Get the games!

This is really easy. You can find all games listed here: http://games. gamepressure.com/games_ encyclopedia.asp?PLA=1&C ZA=3&SOR=2

Note: Only use Games that are released in the FUTURE!

You will use every single game which is on the list for maximum success!

Step 2: Create the download and post the games to your blog

Now, find out if there is a beta for the game you have choosen out there. If there is, copy the link tot he beta and put it in a .txt file. If you can’t find a beta, simply write „Sorry, for this game is no beta available!“ in the .txt file and upload it to IMPremium.

Now, go to your WordPress admin Panel and create a new post, the thread title should be something like „Max Payne 3 free beta Download!“ (if the game you want to promote is „Max Payne 3“

The Post itself should contain an image from the game (which you can get from gamepressure.com) and a little info about the game (which you also can copy from gamepressure.com). And at the bottom, you should place the link to the .txt file you uploaded to IMPremium.

Now publish this post!


Step 3: Get a Video and promote it!

Now you have to promote it. Do it for every single video, this will drive crazy ammounts of traffic to your site!

Go to youtube and find a trailer for your game. Then download that trailer using the firefox plugin „DownloadHelper“.

BONUS: You can now open the trailer in a movie editing porgramm and watermark it with a link to the post on your blog!

Get some YouTube accounts here: http://www.mycheapjobs.com/Social-Marketing/5736/give-you-10-youtube-PVA-accounts

(10 are enough, you can upload all videos to all accounts!)

When you have the accounts, login to one oft hem and upload your video. The title should say something like „Max Payne 3 Free Beta Download 100% Working“. In the description of the video you simply put something along the lines: „Get your free beta code here: http://linktoyourblog“

Now repeat the last step for all 10 accounts you made. Make title and description a bit different every time!

If you have done this, get some likes to one of your videos (should be enough, not to all 10 copied videos!) from here: http://www.mycheapjobs.com/Social- Marketing/5737/give-you- 50 - Real-Human-likes-for-your- Youtube -video-QUICKLY
This will give your video a boost!

Thats already it. Easy as that. Do that for as much games as possible! The more games you post, the more visitors and downloads you will get!

If you have any questions, just ask me in the thread!
