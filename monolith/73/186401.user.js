Trained in counseling, he looked at the<img class="alignright" alt="Dr. Jantz talks about recovery" src="http://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/img/jantz_speaker.jpg" width="129" height="101">treatment options available and realized something was missing. In all areas of need from eating disorders to depression hurting people went to a doctor, a psychiatrist, a counselor, and a pastor, going from place to place looking for Hope, help and healing from their pain. At each junction, they received help for a piece of the puzzle, but that puzzle often remained unsolved.</p><p>Instead of settling for fractured care, Dr. Jantz created The Center, known as “a place of hope”. leaders in whole-person care where people find comprehensive, coordinated care from a treatment team using a whole-person model “inspired healthcare” addressing medical, physical, psychological, emotional, nutritional, fitness and spiritual factors involved in recovery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Adolescent Eating Disorder Program For Anorexia Help, Bulimia Help and Binge Eating Help, and other Eating Disorders</h2><p>Elements of the above-referenced programs for eating disorders are tailored to the unique needs of anorexics, bulimics and compulsive overeaters in our Adolescent Eating Disorder Program.
