From the creators of Hill Racing, here's Benji Bananas, which is a completely different game but has several things in common. First off, the intense use of physics; and secondly, the childish design to make sure you don't take this game too seriously, at least till you are playing it and struggling to beat your high score.

Game's easy to learn: tap to start, tap to grab a liana and tap to release it. Pick up as many bananas as you can and try to avoid obstacles as brambles or pointed peak birds of the paradise. On your side, a friendly gorilla can kick you far away from the start, among many other friends. The ultimate goal is to fulfill all the quests to win over you loved Chimpanzeella, who will become less reluctant every time and pass from the friend zone to "engaged" and who knows what then. Controls can be quite awkward at the very beginning, but you will get the hang (never a truer word) of it pretty quickly, 

A special mention is deserved for a lovely jungle flute music and that surprising use of the "Oberture" every time you start a new stage. By the way, even when it looks like an endless game there are different stages instead, every one with its own background and peculiarities.

Yes, it's a cliche, but Benji Bananas is one of the most fun games so far this year, its design is outstanding and has a high-end playability. And it's free, though you can always visit the "banana shop" to get some unneeded upgrades to boost your progress.

Note 05/15/13: new updates for this Benji Bananas include a new character, new levels and customization options. Great!
