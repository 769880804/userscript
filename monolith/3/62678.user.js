/*
   When looking for a player to add I always have to select average stats (monthly for
   Roti and weekly for H2H) and sort by Rank to see the players with a hot streak. 

   I eventually "fixed" (no pun intended) the search to match what I was looking for.
   This is useful for me and may not be for you.
   
   Anyway I recommend you sort by O-Rank from time to time in order not to miss those
   injured FA's.

   Change log:

      2010-Sep-24  Modified h2h filter from "Last 7 Days (avg)" to "Last 14 Days (avg)",
                   being more representative if only two games were played last week.
      2009-Nov-30  Added the h2h check to filter by "Last Week (avg)" in that case.
      2009-Nov-23  Initial version. 
   
   Known issues:
       None at the moment.

   Credits:
       Based mainly on Yahoo! Fantasy Baseball URL Target Fixer by Dan Russell.
       By the way, his script works for basketball just changing the include URL.
