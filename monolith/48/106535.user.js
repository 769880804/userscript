	Do NOT remove the @require line for script 123889. Those parts are

	Do NOT remove the @include for the launch page:

	If you want to make a sidekick that is for WM 2 before WM 3 is

			{name:"spackle", event:"basics"},

			//matchByParam function and pulling only items where 
			//flags matches
			//see more about this on the wiki
			{name:"xp", flags:"basics"},
			
			//JUST TO RECAP: 
			
			//The name is the visual name of the
			//material, both in posts, and in your menu. The menu
			//will automatically capitalize the first letter of
			//every word. Words like XP will display as Xp unless
			//you fix them below.
			//The id field should not be confused as the 
			//bonus type code. The id is NOT the type code of an item 
			//UNLESS you use the id field. That means if you omit the
			//id field, the type code of an item is the NAME field in 
			//lower case minus spaces. If you DO supply an id field, 
			//the searches will use it as the text by which your material 
			//is detected. For instance, if you want to identify 
			//blueberries, but the post says fruit, you then specify an 
			//id of "fruit" not "blueberries", in which case the 
			//type code of your item is ALSO "fruit" not "blueberries".
			//If you don't like that scenario, find information
			//regarding my flags for enforcing menu NAME fields
			//as internal id's.
			//If you supply no event field, the script will put
			//that material in an "Unsorted" group. That can be messy.
			//All other fields are optional, and you may use them
			//however you want.

/* Recent Changes ********************************************************
	2012.10.XX:
	
	Changes in the wmLibrary script (123889 included above) now allow 
	for better communication with the WM host. These changes will only 
	work for users of WM 3 and above. If you intend to grant backward 
	support, you may continue delivering status codes via 
	window.top.location.hash or a forced redirect to something WM can 
	see. The sidekick can now be flagged with "postMessageCompatible"
	which will cause WM 3's sidekick handler to only listen for WM3 
	compatible return values. Omitting that flag will cause the sidekick 
	handler to only look for WM2 compatible location.hash values.
	I have commented the exact locations of these changes.
	
	The sample tests below have been updated to reflect form-2 tests 
	introduced early in WM 2 during changes to the dynamic grabber. 
	Form-2 is the preferred method for WM3, but there is nothing
	stopping you from using the shorter Form-1 search/find combinations. 
	See the wiki for more details.
	
	The automatic updater script reference has been removed. Updating 
	should now be handled by the script runner.
	
	2012.10.09: 
	
	Edited top level special events (way up top) to help prevent
	firing the listener at the launch page which was wasteful.
	
	Added option to automatically support WM2 status returning if enabled.
	Simply toggle the true/false value.
	
	Added some revised notes to various sections in this script.
	Hopefully those notes will clarify a few things I already discussed
	here and in the wiki page for this script.
	
	2012.11.04:
	
	Added flag "worksInChrome" to be used only if your sk runs in chrome
	even if your script is not flagged "postMessageCompatible". I suspect
	this is going to be rare, since most sidekicks break on chrome with
	the old method due to cross-domain issues (top document not matching
	host name of inner iframes, such as farmville.com and 
	apps.facebook.com/onthefarm).
	
	If you want a debug console such as found in the WM host script,
	you need to include the line...
	// @require        http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/128747.user.js
	...in your script header. Beware that the debug window will start on 
	ANY AND EVERY window/iframe in which the sidekick runs, for any reason.
	Calling any log() commands from the sidekick on those windows will
	generally make a mess when used with nested iframes. You should only
	use the debug window in those frames if you really need them, and 
	should remove the debug console before release. Using the debug console
	on the top document is a much better method, for which you can use
	a modified version of the log() function if needed.
	
	Added better documentation for sidekick parts. Documentation includes 
	changes to the synAppId and addFilters parts.
	
	2012.11.14:
	
	Added better clarification for name and id relationship in the
	automatic materials object.
	
	Added a bit more about special flags.
	
	Although host support for various sidekick types is experimental,
	documentation has been added for the skType parameter of the
	Sidekick.dock function.

	2013.12.20:
	
	Updated include lines to make way for secure protocol. This version includes
	only secure protocol. If you want both, change the https to http*

        Updated Read()/Dock() split to look for location.host instead of
	location.href
