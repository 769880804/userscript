In this strategy game in real time, you must build cities in the Roman Empire which may survive the attacks of enemies and at the same time develop their own battalions and armies resources to its troops able to beat opponents. Gradually, their territory will expand and you can count on stronger fighters.

The game is divided into two stages: when you can build and improve the foundations of their camp (later city) and when you decide to face the enemy in battle.

For you to develop structures of your city, you must obtain natural resources such as food and minerals capable of evolving place. As your degree, you can build certain types of buildings (such as towers protecting farms, armories, etc.). The buildings take a few minutes to be ready and you can terminate them instantly to the price of a few crowns.

You can view what each building can provide by clicking on them - moreover, with their information resources are permanently displayed in the city. Your soldiers can also be trained to get stronger (which requires a lot of food). As you evolve, other warriors are enabled, as archers and swordsmen.

When you get in the way of confrontation (by clicking Campaign), the Warriors will battle automatically in stages, so it is important to determine what are the fighters you want in your struggles. To win, you must destroy the halls of the stricken cities. If all buildings are also destroyed, you get more points at the end of matches.
