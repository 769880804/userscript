- Logs to new "Info" tab found in the Nav menu.
* BotCheck-Bypass:
- Saves what you are doing and redirects to Bypass.
- Auto-Bypass of botcheck. (No user input).
- Continue what you were doing before botcheck.
* Remove annoying text and headers:
- Makes editing logs twice as fast. (No scrolling)
* Add new links to Nav menu:
- "Info": Shows captured banks/IP's from camping.
- "Camp": Link to start camping the IP you are logged into. (You must be logged into a VPC/NPC/GS and hit access logfile before this link appears).
- "Stop": Stops the camping process.
